A few days ago I gave a Eve talk at FOSDEM 2014 in Brussels. The talk was given
in a fully packed Python DevRoom, which granted for a lot of smart questions
both in the final QA session and later during the day. 

I thought that you might find  the talk slides interesting, especially if you
need to explain what is Eve to your boss or colleagues ;-), so here you have
it:

`REST APIs for Humans`_ (FOSDEM 2014, Brussels)

PS: In preparation for the upcoming Eve 0.3 release, `Cerberus 0.6`_ was
released a couple days ago. Expect the 0.3 announcement in your inbox anytime
now.
