Lately I have been receiving a lot of enquiries on how to properly handle REST
API authentication, so I wrote a couple of tutorials that will hopefully shread
some light on the topic. They're filed under `RESTful Account Management`_ and
cover both Basic and Token-Based Authentication scenarios.

Besides the obvious immediate usefulness in solving the issue at hand, I find
that tutorials offer a golden opportunity to grasp how apparently unrelated
features can be assembled togheter to solve a problem. So just let me know if
you'd like to see more *howtos*.
