This release marks the introduction of several new features along with a few
changes and fixes.

- Sub-Resources_!
- Unique identifier fields can now be of arbitrary types, not only ObjectIds.
  See the brand new `Custom IDs Tutorial`_.
- It is now possible to completely disable support for the ``If-Match`` header (use
  at your own risk). 
- New ``pre_<method>`` event hooks are available. They are raised when a request
  is received and before it is processed. See the updated `Event Hooks`_ section.
- Lots of new customization options. See Configuration_.
- Default `embedded documents`_ can now be defined at any endpoint.
- Default sorting can be defined at any resource endpoint.
- Settings can be also passed as a python dictionary.
- Custom JSON encoders can now be used with the framework.

As always, see the changelog_ for details on all updates.
