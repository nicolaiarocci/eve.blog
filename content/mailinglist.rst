The Eve Mailing List
====================

The `Eve Mailing List`_ is intended to be a low traffic resource for
developers, contributors and maintainers. 

I'm opening it because I keep receiving emails about Eve and its satellite
projects Cerberus_ and Events_.  While I'm more than happy to reply to invidual
requests, I feel it is a real pity that valuable information is not being
shared between users. I'm also hoping that experienced Eve users will want to
contribute with their own advice and experiences, something that is already
happening elsewhere.

Also, a mailing list is browsable, searchable, and covers all timezones,
something the current IRC room cannot do.
