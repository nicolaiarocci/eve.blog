Eve 0.0.6 Released
==================

:date: 2013-05-13
:category: develop
:tags: releases

The two main features introduced by this release are `Event Hooks`_ and
`Projections`_. Event hooks allow to subscribe to ``GET``, ``POST``, ``PATCH``,
``DELETE`` requests with mutiple callbacks. Projections are conditional queries
where the client dictates which fields should be returned by the API (when
projections are omitted the whole document is returned). 

We also added support for HEAD requests, made sure that only fields defined in
resource schemas are returned, and applied a bunch of performance
optimizations, especially with regard to ``POST`` (Eve now performs bulk
database inserts) and ``ETag`` computation.  Also, if you have been
experiencing 400s make sure to download this release, as a couple of
significant bugs have been squashed. See the changelog_ for all the news.

Thanks to all the people who contributed either with patches or by opening
tickets and reporting bugs. In no particular order: Ondrej Slint√°k, Thomas
Sileo, Tomasz Jezierski, Nicolas Bazire, Nicola Carlier, maksim2042, Xu Wang,
Asdine El Hrychy, hluz, chronidev, Gianfranco Palumbo.
