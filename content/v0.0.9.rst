v0.0.9 with Python 3.3 support
==============================

:date: 2013-08-29
:category: develop
:tags: releases

This release brings Python 3.3 support and aligns with most recent Flask,
Werkzeug and PyMongo releases. 

There are several backward-compatibility breaking changes, so you might want to
carefully read the changelog_ and check the updated documentation_. Besides Py3
support, the most prominent feature is the new custom userid field now
available to Authentication_ classes, which allows for enhanced flexibility and
easier token revocation when using token-based authentication. 

Thanks to Bryan Cattle and Ryan Shea for their contributions and, as always, to
all those who opened tickets and supported the project so far.
