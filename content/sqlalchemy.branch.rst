There is an ongoing effort to develop a SQLAlchemy data layer for Eve. This is
interesting because it will allow the use of a wide range of SQL databases
(PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, etc.) as storage backends for Eve-powered REST
APIs. 

The current early prototype resides in its own `sqlalchemy branch`_. We are in
the early stages of development and contributors are invited to join the ranks.
There is a lot of room for improvement at all levels: features, tests,
documentation, you name it.

If you want to lend a hand please come visit us on IRC_ so we can better
coordinate efforts. **Jezier** has been working on the SQL features while
**beatpanic** has been playing around with the test suite. Get in touch with
them or with me (Iâ€™m **iaro** on IRC). If IRC is not your cup of tea feel free to
open a ticket_, `email me`_ or submit a pull requests: just make sure it is
against the sqlalchemy branch.
